## Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Connection
**Problem**: Can't connect to Supabase
**Solution**: Verify credentials in `.env`, check project is active

### Build Errors
**Problem**: Build fails
**Solution**: Delete `node_modules`, run `npm install`, try again

### CORS Errors
**Problem**: Frontend can't reach backend
**Solution**: Check Flask-CORS installed, verify URL in code

### Mood Detection Not Working
**Problem**: All messages show neutral mood
**Solution**: Check keyword lists in `chatService.ts`, verify logic
