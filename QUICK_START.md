# Quick Start Guide - AI Mental Health Chatbot

## For Your College Project Demo

### Step 1: Setup Supabase Database (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com and sign up (free)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Copy all content from `backend/setup_database.sql`
5. Paste and click **RUN**
6. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys (2 minutes)

1. In Supabase, go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: https://xxx.supabase.co)
   - **anon public key** (long string starting with eyJ...)

### Step 3: Configure Your App (1 minute)

1. Open `.env` file in project root
2. Replace with your values:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=paste_your_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=paste_your_anon_key_here
```

### Step 4: Run the App (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies (only first time)
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser!

## That's It!

Your mental health chatbot is now running with:
- Real-time chat interface
- Mood detection (happy, sad, anxious, stressed, angry)
- Empathetic AI responses
- Coping strategies
- Crisis detection with emergency resources
- Chat history saved to database

## Test It Out

Try these messages to see different features:

1. **Normal mood**: "Hi, how are you?"
2. **Happy mood**: "I'm feeling great today!"
3. **Sad mood**: "I'm feeling really down and lonely"
4. **Anxious mood**: "I'm so anxious and nervous about everything"
5. **Crisis detection**: "I'm thinking about hurting myself" (will show emergency resources)

## For Your Presentation

### Key Features to Demonstrate

1. **Safety First**: Show the disclaimer modal on startup
2. **Mood Detection**: Send different mood messages and show color-coded responses
3. **Coping Strategies**: Point out the practical tips in bot responses
4. **Crisis Detection**: Demonstrate the emergency banner (use carefully in presentation)
5. **Database**: Show Supabase dashboard with stored messages
6. **Analytics**: Show mood_analytics table in database

### Architecture Overview (for questions)

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
**Backend**: Direct Supabase integration (optional Python Flask backend included)
**Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security
**AI/NLP**: Keyword matching + sentiment analysis (TextBlob in Python version)

### Project Highlights

1. **Production-Ready**: Clean code, TypeScript, proper error handling
2. **Secure**: Row Level Security, no PII storage, anonymous sessions
3. **Ethical**: Clear disclaimers, emergency resources, not replacing therapy
4. **Scalable**: Cloud database, deployable to any platform
5. **Full-Stack**: Both frontend-only and full-stack options

## Optional: Python Backend

If you want to use the advanced Python NLP backend:

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLP data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('brown')"

# Run backend
python app.py
```

Backend runs at http://localhost:5000 with endpoints:
- POST `/api/session/create` - Create session
- POST `/api/chat` - Send message
- GET `/api/history/<session_id>` - Get chat history
- GET `/api/mood-analytics/<session_id>` - Get mood stats

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't connect to database
- Check `.env` file has correct credentials
- Verify you ran the SQL setup in Supabase
- Make sure Supabase project is active (check dashboard)

**Problem**: Page is blank
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Verify `npm run dev` is running without errors
- Try clearing browser cache

**Problem**: "Module not found" errors
- Delete `node_modules` folder
- Run `npm install` again

## Deployment (Optional)

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended for Frontend)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to https://vercel.com
3. Import your repository
4. Add environment variables in Vercel settings
5. Deploy (takes ~2 minutes)

### Deploy Backend to Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Set root directory to `backend`
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy

## Database Tables

Your Supabase project has these tables:

### chat_sessions
Stores each user's chat session (anonymous)

### chat_messages
All messages (user and bot) with mood detection

### mood_analytics
Aggregated mood statistics per session

View them in Supabase: **Table Editor** (left sidebar)
